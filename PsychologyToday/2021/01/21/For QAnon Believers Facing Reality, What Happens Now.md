"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves."--Matthew 7:15

Know when to fold'em
Know when to walk away
And know when to run"

On January 20,2021, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were sworn in as President and Vice President of the United States of America, sealing the deal for the 81 million voters who told President Trump, "you're fired."

For the sizeable minority that voted for Trump, however, many are left feeling cheated. Some were so sure that Trump would win the election that they found his defeat unfathomable. After the final votes were tallied, others embraced Trump's claims-unverified despite more than 50 lawsuits-that the election had been stolen.

A smaller contingent of Trump diehards found solace in more outlandish prophesies that were fed to them within echo chambers on Twitter, YouTube, Parler, or Rumble by prominent QAnon influencers such as Lin Wood. That Trump would rise from the ashes of defeat like a phoenix, retainig power through a military coup. That JFK Jr.would return from the supposed grave. That after Vice President Pence refused to reject the election count, he would be tried for treason or executed. That following the attempted insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, Biden, Hilary Clinton, other "Deep State" luminaries, and even the Pope would finally be exposed to be part of a massive pedophilia ring face military tribunals.
