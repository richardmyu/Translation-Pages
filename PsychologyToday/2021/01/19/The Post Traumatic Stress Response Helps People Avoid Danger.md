Traumatic events throw our brain into an adrenaline-fueled defense response. That response helps us detect, avoid, and defend ourselves from danger. But it is supposed to turn off when the danger has passed. Unfortunately for some, the brain gets stuck and they develop post-traumatic stress disorder. And PTSD hurts. The suffering is intense as they did the first time. Even worse, the daily experience of people with PTSD is so out of step with everyone around them, they can feel isolated.

But is it really fair to call PTSD a disorder? After all, the post-traumatic stress response helps people adapt to dangerous environments and survive them. Is it possible that we are misunderstanding something crusial? Advocates for veterans with PTSD are starting to call for a change.

PTSD has had many names in the past: shell-shock, combat fatigue, war neruosis. In 1980 it was added to the DSM and called Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. That designation was a huge many Vietnam veterans had been incorrectly labeled with schizophrenia.

Shauna Springer, Ph.D., an expert on PTSD, refers to that milestone as a time when people of courage spoke truth to power. "What was an important victory because it said it's not in your head. This is not something you're making up," Springer says. "PTS is in direct proportion to trauma exposures."
