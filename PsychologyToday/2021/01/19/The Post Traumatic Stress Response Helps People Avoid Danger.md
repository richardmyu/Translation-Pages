###### Post traumatic stress starts as useful response to threat, and that matters.

Traumatic events throw our brain into an adrenaline-fueled defense response. That response helps us detect, avoid, and defend ourselves from danger. But it is supposed to turn off when the danger has passed. Unfortunately for some, the brain gets stuck and they develop post-traumatic stress disorder. And PTSD hurts. The suffering is intense as they did the first time. Even worse, the daily experience of people with PTSD is so out of step with everyone around them, they can feel isolated.

But is it really fair to call PTSD a disorder? After all, the post-traumatic stress response helps people adapt to dangerous environments and survive them. Is it possible that we are misunderstanding something crusial? Advocates for veterans with PTSD are starting to call for a change.

PTSD has had many names in the past: shell-shock, combat fatigue, war neruosis. In 1980 it was added to the DSM and called Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. That designation was a huge many Vietnam veterans had been incorrectly labeled with schizophrenia.

Shauna Springer, Ph.D., an expert on PTSD, refers to that milestone as a time when people of courage spoke truth to power. "What was an important victory because it said it's not in your head. This is not something you're making up," Springer says. "PTS is in direct proportion to trauma exposures."

### PTSD is an injury

Since 1980 we've learned a lot about PTSD, and the term 'disorder' makes less sense than it used to. "Terms and our understanding need to continue to evolve as the science evolves. And now what we know is that a healed brain looks different from an injured brain on a brain scan if you use the right brain scan. So PTSD is literally in your head. It is literally an injury, rather than a disorder. And it's an injury that can be healed," says Springer.

Brains of people with PTSD do look different on brain scans. While the findings are extensive, the most noted change is volume loss in the hippocampus, which has been demonstrated in veterans an dsurvivors of childhood abuse. Of note, how much smaller the hippocampus got depended on the severity of the combat or the repeated nature of the childhood trauma. And research also suggests that communication within the stress circuitry of the brain is disrupted in PTSD.

In line with the work of world-renowned psychiatrist Frank Ochberg and anesthesiologist Eugene Lipov, Springer believes we should change the name from PTSD to PTSI(post-traumatic stress injury). "It's an injury that really is about a mismatch between your environment, and what has been adaptive for you in a different environment," she says. She joins in a growing recognition among experts that PTS is not properly a disorder, but an adaptive response to an extreme environment that helps us survive.

"If you think about people who are going into a war zone, the kinds of responses that you need to have to survive in that war zone translate directly into many of the symptoms that we assess for as psychologists. For example, the hyper-vigilance that you need to always be scanning for the threat is absolutely adaptive," Springer explains. "In modern war zones, there is no ceasefire. There is no place that is always behind the wire. As we learned in the Vietnam War, even on secure bases, sometimes the enemy infiltrates our ranks. So, being hyper-vigilant all the time is absolutely adaptive. You need to be always scanning for who is friend and who is foe or for where the threat is." She also points out that PTS's exaggerated startle response primes the body for a rapid response to threat. Many might call this a battle-ready state.

The problem comes in when people leave that war zone and come home. "When people come home to their day to day life they have a mismatch with their environment. They get flooded with adrenaline continually and are primed to respond to perceived threats that are not always real threats. Sometimes they are, but usually they're not. They might understand this logically, but their body has changed at a cellular level," says Springer. "I call this "chronic threat response." But of course, this is not a recognized diafnosis."
