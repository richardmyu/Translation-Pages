We sometimes get stuck thinking that everything was so much better, and easier, in the past. It's one of the tricks our minds play on us, especially when we are feeling vulnerable or overwhelmed.

However, rarely is it actually the case that things were "objectively" better in the past. Psychologists refer to this flawed thought pattern as rosy retrospection. It is a well-studied cognitive bias. It happens because when we think about the past, we are more likely to think about people, events, places, and things in the abstract. And, when we think about things in the abstract, we are more likely to focus on positive generalities than the nitty-gritty and sometimes gory details.

Here's an example: if you think back to a holiday you had with your family, say, five years ago, you're likely to reminisce about the enjoyable conversations you had, the good food you ate, and the great family photos yo were able to take. You're probably not going to remember how uncomfortable the couch was that you slept on for five nights straight, how you had a cold for the entire trip, how your travel plans were complicated by bad weather, and not to mention, how stressful it was being with your extended family for a whole week.
