To put it mildly, psychedelics are having a moment. Oregon has legalized the medicinal use of mshrooms, and MDMA is in final Phase 3 trials, meaning it could be an FDA-approved prescription treatment by 2023. Psychedelic studies are spreading internationally. The therapeutic and medicinal benefits of psychedelics have been written up in outlets as diverse as Christinaity Today, Town & Country, ESPN, Military.com, and AARP. Psychedelic companies are sprouting like mushrooms and their stocks are soaring.

Everybody is feeling the effects of the revolution in psychedelic science. But not everybody can or should participate...chemically. So who are the psychedelic benchwarmers?

### Who Shouldn't Participate

Currently, there are strict exclusion criteria for the pool of applicants in many psychedelic studies: Candidates with schizophrenia, bipolar type I or type II, epilepsy, paranoia, or psychosis are excluded from all psychedelic studies. MDMA studies bar populations with heart issues, hypertension, and liver disease, among others. Sometimes even being related to a person with these conditions is enough to exclude a candidate.

Then there are some classes of people who might consider abstinence as a precautionary measure. Even though psychedelics have been shown to help subjects with substance abuse disorders, certain addicts may understandably want to avoid all  inebriants. Then, of course, there are those for whom the timing is not right: children, parents, expectant mothers, and the highly risk-averse. Olympic athletes, astronauts, and government employees who must submit to regular drug tests may want to steer clear. One study suggests that scientists studying psychedelics are perceived as less trustworthy if they've admitted to substance use. So perhaps even the scientists creating the exclusion criteria should be excluded; the excludor becomes the excludee.

There are ways, though, that the psychedelic renaissance may actually improve the quality of life of the very people who are unable to take them. I'm not talking about a contact high. I'm also not going to reveal that the psychedelics were inside you the entire time. Here are three ways, psychedelics can improve your mental health without you actually ingesting them.
