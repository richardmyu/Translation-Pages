When is the last time you felt awe? That time-stolpping, heart-tugging, WOW-inducing sense of wonder that has been described by psychologist Dacher Keltner as the feeling of "being in the presence of something vast that transcents your understanding of the world." Often, we think of awe as something that requires a divorce from the mundane. Something we might stumble upon while climbing towering summits, meditating under starry heavens, standing inside grandiose galeries and cathedrals.

How, then, can we find awe right here, confined to familier walls and continuous testments of a world that seems all but wonderous?

Despite it associations with the extraordinary, studies show that people can feel awe during ordinary moments of everyday life —— while listening to the stillness of falling snow, while roaring wiht laughter with a loved one, while feeling the heartbreak open from the kindness of strangers. These moments are as unreamarkable as they are priceless. They not only fill our days with quiet magic but according to science, they also do us good. The positive effects of awe on our physical and emotional well-being creative, more generous, and more interconnected.

As we go about our days, preoccupied with the business of living, we may be overlooking one of biggest sources of awe in the universe: our bodies. In his remarkable book *The Body: A Guide For Occupants* ("a directory of wonders," as The Guardian puts it), Bill Bryson explores the orchestra of precision and processes that play out within our cells and organs to keep us going dusk after dawn. Come rain or shine(outside or inside), it won't hurt to pause and acknowledge the marvel that is you.
